         <h3> "I’ve been on every side of liquor licensing—from being a franchise owner myself to advising prominent companies and brands for over 15 years. I know from first-hand experience that the liquor licensing system can be confusing, because it is so different in every municipality, county, and state. Liquor License Advisor knows where to look for answers, and we’re committed to getting creative and thinking big about streamlining the licensing process to make it simple and straightforward." </h3>

      <p>"I have worked with many brokers over the years and consider Dan and team to be the best of the best! Not only do they provide quick professional results, they stay with you throughout the process to ensure the deal moves smoothly and that both parties are satisfied. Without question, they have simplified a process that I used to consider stressful and burdensome."</p>

    <div class="review-column">
      <p style="text-align: center;"> "I recently hired Dan Newcomb and Atlantic License Brokers to facilitate what can only be described as an absurdly difficult all alcohol liquor license transfer.  I am not exaggerating when I say that I do not believe that anybody other than Dan and his team could have gotten this transaction completed and especially under the serious time constraints we faced.  Dan never gave up even when I was ready to myself.  If you want to hire somebody who knows the business, knows the players and knows how to get things done, you won't go wrong with Dan and his team at Atlantic." </p>

      <p style="text-align: center;"> "I have always found Dan Newcomb and his team to be knowledgeable, professional, efficient, and personable.  Yes, they maximize value for their clients, but they also prize the establishment and maintenance of long-term relationships and best practices within the liquor industry." </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"> "Dan and his team are the first – and usually only - stop when I have a client who is looking for a license or looking to sell.  They constantly review inventory in communities across the state, maintain contact with potential buyers and sellers and  stay focused on the goal of a successful license transfer from even before the offer is signed.  Their attention to detail, willingness to do any task and constant communication regarding upcoming milestones assist us in delivering the best possible result for our clients." </p>
