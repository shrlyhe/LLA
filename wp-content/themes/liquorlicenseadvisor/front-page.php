I am not exaggerating when I say that I do not believe that anybody other than Dan and his team could have gotten this transaction completed and especially under the serious time constraints we faced.  Dan never gave up even when I was ready to myself.  If you want to hire somebody who knows the business, knows the players and knows how to get things done, you won't go wrong with Dan and his team at Atlantic." </p>
